# Only for learning and improve Docker skills

## This repository was created only study and skills development reasons.
## I'm a developer with JavaScript, Python, and Java Skills, that know frameworks for those respective languages, as:

- AngularJS and  Angular 2;
- React;
- Flask and Django
- Grails (Yes, a dead framework, but really nice to work within)
